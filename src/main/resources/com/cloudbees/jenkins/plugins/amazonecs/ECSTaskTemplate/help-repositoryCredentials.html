<p>
Private registry authentication for tasks using AWS Secrets Manager enables you to store your credentials securely and 
then reference them in your container definition. This allows your tasks to use images from private repositories. This feature 
is supported by tasks using both the Fargate or EC2 launch types.
</p>
<p>  
The task role specified in the task definition must contain KMS key decrypt permissions ("kms:Decrypt"). Otherwise, image
authentication fails, preventing the container image pull. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/private-auth.html">Learn more</a>

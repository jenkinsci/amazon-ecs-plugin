  Name of AWS EC2 auto scaling group used for managing instances in the selected ECS cluster.
</p>
<p>
  Assuming the instances of your ECS cluster are associated with an auto scaling group, this
  plugin can automatically scale your ECS cluster in and out (and thus prevent you paying for
  idle EC2 instances). If you leave the autoscaling group empty (by selecting the blank/first
  item in the dropdown list), autoscaling will not be enabled.
</p>
<p>
  To make use of the auto scaling feature:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create an auto scaling group with a minimum of 0 instances and maximum of M instances (with M >= 1)</li>
  <li>Make sure the launch configuration associated with your auto scaling group correctly configures the ECS agent (new instances need to register with the ECS cluster; more info <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html">here</a>)</li>
  <li>Make sure the configured IAM credentials for this plugin have permission to use the AWS auto scaling service</li>
</ul>
<p>
  How does scale out work?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>When a job with a label matching an ECS template in your ECS cloud is added to the build queue, this plugin will check the ECS cluster for sufficient resources (memory + cpu as defined in your ECS cloud templates)</li>
  <li>If a running instance is found with sufficient resources, an ECS task will be started to run your job in a fresh docker based jenkins slave</li>
  <li>If no running instances have sufficient free resources (but the auto scaling group has less instances running than the maximum allowed), this plugin will launch an additional instance in your auto scaling group, wait until it's registered in your ECS cluster and launch an ECS task to execute your job.</li>
  <li>If no running instances have sufficient free resources and the auto scaling group is at it's maximum capacity, this plugin will sleep for a while and look again for free resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  How does scale in work?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every ECS cloud defined will be actively monitored for idle instances (once per minute)</li>
  <li>When a running ECS instance is detected which is close to the next billing hour and this instance is currently idle (not running any ECS tasks), it will be put in ECS draining state (that means the ECS scheduler will not launch new tasks on this instance).</li>
  <li>A draining ECS instance will be terminated and removed from the auto scaling group; the amount of desired instances in the auto scaling group will be decreased by one.</li>
</ul>

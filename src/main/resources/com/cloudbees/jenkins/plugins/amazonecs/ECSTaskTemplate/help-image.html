Docker image to run as a jenkins agent.
<p>
This image will be ran passing command "<code>-url [jenkins url] [slave jnlp secret] [slave name]</code>". Those are
the parameters expected by
<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/src/main/java/hudson/remoting/jnlp/Main.java">Jenkins remoting JNLP launcher</a>.
You can use or inherit from  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/jnlp-slave/">jenkinsci/jnlp-slave</a>
Docker image so you dont' have to wory about those implementation details.
